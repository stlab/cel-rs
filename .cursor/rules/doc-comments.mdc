This rule provides a standard for Rust doc comment.

Doc comments should be formatted with line comments in accordance with the [Rust Style
Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/style-guide/#doc-comments).

All public components should have documentation following the convensions defined in [The RustDoc Book](mdc:https:/doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/how-to-write-documentation.html).

Documentation for functions should always start with a short summary that describes what the
function does. Additional exposition is usually not necessary unless the function has preconditions
that may lead to a error result or panic.

For functions that recognize a grammar production, the production is a sufficient comment.

Module comments should contain more exposition and examples and serve as a tutorial for how to use
the components in the module.
