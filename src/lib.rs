/*!
cel-rs provides a Forth-like runtime for developing domain specific languages. A program is composed of segments, where each segment is a sequence of operations.

Segments can be created in two ways.

1. Using the `DynSegment` struct which validates the type safety of the operations at runtime as the segment is built.
2. Using the `Segment` struct, which validates the type safety of the operations at compile time.

The two types of segments can be converted to each other [not yet implemented].

# Examples

```rust
use cel_rs::type_list::{List, IntoList};

// Create a type list from a tuple
let list = (1, "hello", 3.14).into_list();
```
